It is also simply known as "rice cake". While it can be eaten all year round, traditionally it is most popular during the Chinese New Year. It is considered good luck to eat nian gao during this time of the year because nian gao is a homonym for "higher year" or "grow every year", which means "a more prosperous year". The character 年 is literally translated as "year", and the character 糕 is literally translated as "cake" and is identical in sound to the character 高, meaning "tall" or "high". Nian gao also has the exact homonym for "sticky cake"; the character 粘, meaning "sticky".<br><br></td>
